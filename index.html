    <p>While online platforms for collaboration are more prevalent than ever it can feel as though commercial design practice is become a more and more isolated and formulaic practice (Clancy and McElveen, 2016). How can designers engage in and create new systems that sit outside of mainstream convention and expectation? In my practice I am exploring queering and subverting preexisting structures to examine their hierarchies and effects and how collaboration and exchange can facilitate structures that better serve and empower communities - in my case the trans community. This work is set within the social context of hypercapitalism and the ever-increasing speed of the image machine as well as considering how social hierarchy effects design structures. Collaboration is a queering of current design structures because it necessitates slowing down in an era of speed.</p>

    <p>When I refer to collaboration in this context I am describing the process of working with others within design practice. This can include input in the content such as submissions, artworks and and other self-encapsulated work but also refers to collaboration in process, conception, form and creation where decision making is acted upon with multiple parties involved. Many collaborative design practices do not ascribe to simply one or the other but fall somewhere between the two. For example,  the radical queer magazine Square Peg which includes collaboration through submissions and within design but not format or finer design details. Square Peg was largely varied and inclusive in content but not in form. Equally there are collaborations that had single sources of content but collaborative in their design and production such as the collaborative atlas created by REF in which participants designed single pages that in turn made a complete atlas. This system includes collaboration but requires it to function as a one way interaction; with the editor or publisher setting terms for included work and participants having no say in the final designed product except for the inclusion of their work. They may write an article only for it to be placed on the page before an article arguing the complete opposite point. How does this effect the credibility of their work? Where the lines of how far a designer can edit submitted work? Cropping an image? Changing the typesetting? How much does the editor or designer owe in terms of how their work is presented? I propose that in work that touts itself as collaborative there must be opportunity for conversation around such questions; a give and take with an aim to understand that breaks down the hierarchy of designer and participant. After all the work does not exist without the submitted content and the content is not shown without the frame of the design form.</p>
